Welcome to the Next.js base App Router template bootstrapped using the `create-next-app`. This template supports TypeScript, but you can use normal JavaScript as well.

## Getting Started
Hit the run button to start the development server.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More
Find out more about the structure of the new Next.js App Router at the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs). Make sure the dropdown on the left shows 'Using App Router.'

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on `/api/hello`. This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello.ts`.

The `app/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Productionizing your Next App
To make your next App run smoothly in production make sure to [turn this repl to an always-on repl.](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/enabling-always-on)

You can also produce a production build by running `npm run build` and [changing the run command](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/configuring-repl#run) to `npm run start`.
